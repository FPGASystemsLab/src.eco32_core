# ECO32 Core TRACE Unit Documentation

## Overview

The TRACE unit in the ECO32 processor is a specialized module designed for real-time monitoring and debugging of processor operations. It captures and logs various processor events, instruction execution, and data transfers, providing valuable insights for debugging, performance analysis, and system monitoring.

## Key Features

- Real-time instruction tracing
- Memory access monitoring
- Register write-back tracking
- Network interface operation logging
- Configurable trace buffer sizes
- Overflow detection and handling
- Timestamped event recording

## Architecture

The TRACE unit is implemented in the `eco32_core_trace_box.v` file and consists of several key components:

1. **Input Interface**: Receives signals from various processor units (IFU, IDU, LSU, etc.)
2. **Trace Buffer**: Stores captured events in a FIFO structure
3. **Control Logic**: Manages trace enabling/disabling and configuration
4. **Output Interface**: Formats and transmits trace data to external systems
5. **Timestamp Generator**: Provides timing information for traced events

## Tracing Process

1. The TRACE unit monitors signals from different processor components
2. When a traceable event occurs, it captures relevant data (addresses, opcodes, register values)
3. Event data is timestamped and formatted into trace packets
4. Packets are stored in the trace buffer
5. When the buffer reaches a threshold or upon request, data is transmitted to external systems

## Traced Events

The TRACE unit captures several types of events:

- **Instruction Fetch**: Records PC values and instruction opcodes
- **Memory Operations**: Logs memory addresses, data values, and operation types (read/write)
- **Register Operations**: Tracks register write-back operations and values
- **Network Interface**: Monitors network packet transmissions and receptions
- **System Events**: Records exceptions, interrupts, and mode changes

## Packet Format

Each trace packet includes:

- Event type identifier
- Timestamp
- Source unit identifier
- Relevant addresses (PC, memory address)
- Data values
- Status flags

## Buffering Mechanism

The TRACE unit implements a sophisticated buffering system:

- Configurable buffer depth
- Overflow detection and handling
- Priority-based event filtering
- Compression techniques to maximize buffer utilization

## Integration with Processor

The TRACE unit is tightly integrated with the ECO32 processor core:

- Minimal impact on processor performance
- Non-intrusive monitoring
- Configurable trace granularity
- Selective tracing capabilities

## Performance Considerations

- The TRACE unit is designed to have minimal impact on processor performance
- Trace operations can be enabled/disabled dynamically
- Selective tracing allows focusing on specific events of interest
- Buffer management prevents overflow conditions from affecting processor operation

## Configuration Parameters

The TRACE unit provides several configurable parameters:

- `TRACE_BUFFER_DEPTH`: Controls the size of the trace buffer
- `TRACE_ENABLE`: Enables/disables tracing functionality
- `TRACE_FILTER_MASK`: Selects which event types to trace
- `TRACE_TIMESTAMP_ENABLE`: Controls timestamp generation
- `TRACE_COMPRESSION_ENABLE`: Enables/disables trace data compression

## Applications

The TRACE unit serves several important functions:

1. **Debugging**: Helps identify and resolve software and hardware issues
2. **Performance Analysis**: Provides insights into execution patterns and bottlenecks
3. **Security Monitoring**: Can detect unusual execution patterns or unauthorized access
4. **System Verification**: Validates correct operation of the processor
5. **Development Support**: Assists in software development and optimization

## Technical Implementation Details

The TRACE unit is implemented in Verilog and consists of approximately 950 lines of code. Key implementation aspects include:

- Efficient state machine design for event capture
- Optimized buffer management
- Low-latency signal monitoring
- Configurable filtering logic
